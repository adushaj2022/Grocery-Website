		<p class = "about_page">Goods N' Go is a grocery delivery service where you can order grocercies to be delivered to your door fresh from local grocery stores.
	All of this can be done from the comfort of your home with just a few clicks. Think of us as the Uber for groceries. 
	Many college students have to walk very far to the grocery store and for some it might even be too far to walk. For the people who can't walk there, 
	it forces them to either take an Uber there and back, to find a ride from a friend, or to not even go at all. This makes Goods N' GO 
	great for college students.</p>
